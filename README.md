# ChessFigureMoveCalculator

This is my first project on C#. 
The goal of this project for me was to create a simple but extendable app
for calculating chess figures' legal moves on a board of potentially any size
with arbitrary positioned figures of any kind that can be provided with any
type of movement strategy.
I tried to implement this code as clean and as structered as I could. Think it
turned out really well. This piece of code can easily be extended to a
full-fledged chess game (this is my plan for the future).
